# Security Policy

## Supported
We are a community project and strive to address security issues quickly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please email the maintainers (replace with a real contact) at:
**security-contact@your-project.example**

Alternatively, open a new issue with the title prefix `[SECURITY]` and
do not include sensitive details; a maintainer will contact you privately.

Please provide:
- A description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (if available)
- Your environment and version(s)

We prefer coordinated disclosure. We will credit reporters if desired.
