# Non-Infringement Scope (draft)

Goal: **Avoid known third-party patents** while advancing ternary computing.

- Prefer **prior art** and **public domain** methods
- Keep implementations **simple** and **well-documented**
- Track external references in `docs/` and cite them clearly
- Patent **non-assert pledge** is included in this project

If in doubt, open a Discussion issue before implementing.
