# Governance

Light-weight, transparent governance:
- **Maintainers:** listed in `CODEOWNERS`
- **Decisions:** by PR review and consensus; if unclear, maintainer final say
- **Releases:** semantic versioning once the first public artifacts are tagged
- **Roadmap:** maintained in `docs/roadmap.md`
- **Community:** GitHub Discussions

Changes to governance happen via pull request to this page.
